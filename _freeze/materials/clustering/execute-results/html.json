Generated using the DALL-E tool.](images/taj_mahal.jpg)\n\n\n## Clustering Overview\n\nClustering is an **unsupervised learning** technique used to group similar data points together. Unlike classification, there are no pre-defined labels. Instead, the algorithm tries to discover structure in the data by maximizing intra-cluster similarity and minimizing inter-cluster similarity.\n\n**Key points:**\n\n- **Objective:** Identify natural groupings in the data.  \n\n- **Applications:** Customer segmentation, image compression, anomaly detection, document clustering.\n\n\n## Hierarchical Clustering\n\nHierarchical clustering builds a tree (dendrogram) of clusters using either a **bottom‑up** (agglomerative) or **top‑down** (divisive) approach.\n\n### Agglomerative (Bottom‑Up)\n\n1. **Initialization:** Start with each data point as its own cluster.  \n\n2. **Merge Steps:**  \n   - Compute distance between every pair of clusters.  \n   - Merge the two closest clusters.  \n   - Update the distance matrix.  \n\n3. **Termination:** Repeat until all points are in a single cluster or a stopping criterion (e.g., desired number of clusters) is met.\n\n\n\n### Dendrogram\n\n```text\n        [ALL POINTS]\n         /      \\\n    Cluster A   Cluster B\n     /    \\       /    \\\n    …      …     …      …\n```\n\n\n- **Cutting the tree** at different levels yields different numbers of clusters.\n- **Linkage methods** determine how distance between clusters is computed:\n  - **Single linkage:** Minimum pairwise distance  \n  - **Complete linkage:** Maximum pairwise distance  \n  - **Average linkage:** Average pairwise distance  \n\n\n\n\n### Important Concepts\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n- **Metric**  \n  The *metric* (or *distance function* or *dissimilarity function*) defines how you measure the distance between individual data points. Common choices include Euclidean, Manhattan (cityblock), or cosine distance. This metric determines the raw pairwise distances.\n\n\n*Manhattan distance*\n\n![Manhattan distance.

Image created using DreamUp.](images/crow_manhattan.jpg)\n\n\n![Euclidean distance](images/euclidean_distance.png)\n\n\n\n- **Linkage**  \n  The *linkage* method defines how to compute the distance between two clusters based on the pairwise distances of their members. Examples:  \n  - **Single**: the distance between the closest pair of points (one from each cluster).  \n  - **Complete**: the distance between the farthest pair of points.  \n  - **Average**: the average of all pairwise distances.  \n  - **Ward**: the merge that minimizes the increase in total within‑cluster variance.  \n\n*Linkage function*\n\n![Linkage function](images/linkage_function.png)\n\n:::\n<!-- end callout -->\n\n\n| Linkage Method        | How It Works                                                                                     | Intuition                                                                                       |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Single**            | Distance = minimum pairwise distance between points in the two clusters                         | “Friends‑of‑friends” – clusters join if any two points are close, yielding chain‑like clusters  |\n| **Complete**          | Distance = maximum pairwise distance between points in the two clusters                         | “Everyone must be close” – only merge when all points are relatively near, producing compact clusters |\n| **Average (UPGMA)**   | Distance = average of all pairwise distances between points in the two clusters                 | Balances single and complete by averaging close and far pairs                                  |\n| **Weighted (WPGMA)**  | Distance = average of the previous cluster’s distance to the new cluster (equal weight per cluster) | Prevents large clusters from dominating, giving equal say to each cluster                      |\n| **Centroid**          | Distance = distance between the centroids (mean vectors) of the two clusters                    | Merges based on “centers of mass,” but centroids can shift non‑monotonically                   |\n| **Median (WPGMC)**    | Distance = distance between the medians of the two clusters                                      | More robust to outliers than centroid linkage, but can also invert dendrogram order            |\n| **Ward’s**            | Merge that minimizes the increase in total within‑cluster sum of squares (variance)             | Keeps clusters as tight and homogeneous as possible, often resulting in evenly sized groups     |\n\n\n### Single Linkage\n- **How it works**: Measures the distance between two clusters as the smallest distance between any single point in one cluster and any single point in the other.  \n- **Intuition**: “Friends‑of‑friends” clustering—if any two points (one from each cluster) are close, the clusters join. Can produce long, straggly chains of points.\n\n### Complete Linkage\n- **How it works**: Measures the distance between two clusters as the largest distance between any point in one cluster and any point in the other.  \n- **Intuition**: “Everyone must be close”—clusters merge only when all their points are relatively near each other, leading to tight, compact groups.\n\n### Average Linkage (UPGMA)\n- **How it works**: Takes the average of all pairwise distances between points in the two clusters.  \n- **Intuition**: A middle‑ground between single and complete linkage—balances the effect of very close and very far pairs by averaging them.\n\n### Weighted Linkage (WPGMA)\n- **How it works**: Similar to average linkage, but treats each cluster as a single entity by averaging the distance from each original cluster to the target cluster, regardless of cluster size.  \n- **Intuition**: Prevents larger clusters from dominating the average—gives each cluster equal say in how far apart they are.\n\n### Centroid Linkage\n- **How it works**: Computes the distance between the centroids (mean vectors) of the two clusters.  \n- **Intuition**: Clusters merge based on whether their “centers of mass” are close. Can sometimes lead to non‑monotonic merges if centroids shift oddly.\n\n### Median Linkage (WPGMC)\n- **How it works**: Uses the median point of each cluster instead of the mean when computing distance between clusters.  \n- **Intuition**: Like centroid linkage but more robust to outliers, since the median isn’t pulled by extreme values—though can also cause inversion issues.\n\n### Ward’s Method\n- **How it works**: At each step, merges the two clusters whose union leads to the smallest possible increase in total within‑cluster variance (sum of squared deviations).  \n- **Intuition**: Always chooses the merge that keeps clusters as tight and homogeneous as possible, often yielding groups of similar size and shape.\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Concept about distances\n\nThere is no single \"best\" distance metric for clustering—what works well for one dataset or problem may not work for another. The choice of distance metric (such as Euclidean, or Manhattan) depends on the nature of your data and what you want to capture about similarity. \n\nFor example, Euclidean distance works well when the scale of features is meaningful and differences are linear, while cosine distance is better for text data or situations where the direction of the data matters more than its magnitude.\n\nIt is important to experiment with different distance metrics and see which one produces clusters that make sense for your specific problem. Always check the results and, if possible, use domain knowledge to guide your choice.\n:::\n<!-- end callout -->\n\n\n## Practical\n\n* `n_clusters` in `AgglomerativeClustering` specifies the number of clusters you want the algorithm to find. After building the hierarchical tree, the algorithm will cut the tree so that exactly `n_clusters` groups are formed. For example, `n_clusters`=3 will result in 3 clusters in your data.\n\n* The default value for n_clusters in `AgglomerativeClustering` is 2.\nThe default value for linkage is `ward`. So if you do not specify these parameters, the algorithm will produce 2 clusters using `Ward` linkage.\n\n::: {#a2edb1a3 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\nfrom scipy.cluster.hierarchy import linkage, dendrogram\nfrom sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\n# Load data\niris = load_iris()\nX = iris.data\n\n# Fit Agglomerative Clustering\nagg = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=3, linkage='ward')\nlabels = agg.fit_predict(X)\n\nprint(labels)  #

Since we do not have a single _correct_ answer, we use several methods that fall into three main categories:\n\n### 1. Internal Evaluation\nMeasures how good the clustering is based only on the data itself (e.g., how dense and well-separated the clusters are).\n\n### 2. External Evaluation\nMeasures how well the clustering results align with known, ground-truth labels. This is possible here because the NCI60 dataset has known cancer cell line types, which we loaded as `labs`.\n\n### 3. Visual Evaluation\nInspecting plots (like the dendrogram or PCA) to see if the groupings seem logical.\n\n---\n\nLet us add the two most common metrics: one internal and one external.\n\n---\n\n### Internal Evaluation: Silhouette Score\n\nThe **Silhouette Score** measures how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation).\n\n- **Score Range**: -1 to +1  \n- **Interpretation**:\n  - **+1**: The sample is far away from the neighboring clusters (very good).\n  - **0**: The sample is on or very close to the decision boundary between two neighboring clusters.\n  - **-1**: The sample is assigned to the wrong cluster.\n\n---\n\n### External Evaluation: Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)\n\nThe **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)** measures the similarity between the true labels (`labs`) and the labels assigned by our clustering algorithm (`cluster_labels`). It accounts for chance groupings.\n\n- **Score Range**: -1 to +1  \n- **Interpretation**:\n  - **+1**: Perfect agreement between true and predicted labels.\n  - **0**: Random labeling (no correlation).\n  - **< 0**: Worse than random labeling.\n\n\n* Here is how you would implement this\n\n::: {#2d45e363 .cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score, adjusted_rand_score # Import evaluation metrics\n\n# Hierarchical Clustering\nagg = AgglomerativeClustering(linkage='average', metric='manhattan')\ncluster_labels = agg.fit_predict(X)\n\n# 1.

A \"good\" clustering is one for which the _within‑cluster variation_ is minimized.\n\n\n### Elbow point\n\nWhen using **k‑means clustering**, one of the key questions is: how many clusters (k) should I choose? The **elbow method** is a simple, visual way to pick a reasonable _k_ by looking at how the “within‑cluster” variation decreases as _k_ increases.\n\n---\n\n#### 1. The Within‑Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)\n\nFor each choice of _k_, you run k‑means and compute the **within‑cluster sum of squares** (WCSS), also called _inertia_ or _distortion_. This is the sum of squared Euclidean distances between each point and the centroid of its cluster:\n\n![WCSS](images/wcss_equation.png)\n\n<!--\n\\[\n\\text{WCSS}(k) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sum_{x \\in C_i} \\lVert x - \\mu_i \\rVert^2\n\\]\n-->\n\n- $C_{i}$ is cluster _i_  \n- $mu_{i}$ is the centroid of cluster _i_  \n\nAs _k_ increases, WCSS will always decrease (or stay the same), because more centroids can only reduce distances.\n\n\n#### 2. Plotting WCSS versus _k_\n\n1. **Choose a range** for _k_ (e.g. 1 to 10).  \n2. **For each _k_**, fit k‑means and record `WCSS(k)`.  \n3. **Plot** `WCSS(k)` on the _y_-axis against _k_ on the _x_-axis.  \n\nYou will get a curve that starts high at _k_ = 1 and steadily goes down as _k_ increases.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Identifying the \"Elbow\"\n\n- At first, adding clusters dramatically reduces WCSS, because you are splitting large, heterogeneous clusters into more homogeneous groups.  \n- After some point, adding more clusters yields **diminishing returns**—each new cluster only slightly reduces WCSS.  \n\nThe **elbow point** is the value of _k_ at which the decrease in WCSS “bends” most sharply—like an elbow in your arm. It balances model complexity (more clusters) against improved fit (lower WCSS).\n\n![An elbow point](images/elbow_point_clustering.png)\n\n\n### Exercise (k-means)\n\n* NOTE: The `c` parameter in `plt.scatter()` is used to specify the color of the scatter plot points. \n\n::: {#259cfbdb .cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n\n# Load data\niris = load_iris()\nX = iris.data\n\n# Perform k means with k = 2\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=2, n_init=20)\nkmeans.fit(X)\n\n# The cluster assignments of the observations are contained in kmeans.labels_\nkmeans.labels_\n\n# Plot the data, with each observation colored according to its cluster assignment.\nplt.figure()\nplt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c=kmeans.labels_)\nplt.title(\"K-means on Iris data\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](clustering_files/figure-html/cell-11-output-1.png){width=571 height=431}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Exercise (Evaluate k-means clusters using the within-cluster similarity)\n\n\n* Find the optimal value of the number of clusters $K$\n\n::: {#e8b3d5a3 .cell execution_count=11}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n\n# Load data\niris = load_iris()\nX = iris.data\n\n# Plot WCSS (inertia) as a function of the number of clusters\nwcss = []\n\n# try a few different values of k\nk_range = range(1,11)\n\nfor k_var in k_range:\n\n   # fit kmeans\n   kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k_var, random_state=2)\n   kmeans.fit(X)\n\n   # append WCSS to a list\n   wcss.append(kmeans.inertia_)\n\n\n# plot\nplt.figure()\nplt.scatter( k_range , wcss )\nplt.xlabel('Number of clusters')\nplt.ylabel('Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)')\nplt.title('Elbow Method For Optimal')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](clustering_files/figure-html/cell-12-output-1.png){width=593 height=449}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Choosing Between Methods\n\n### Hierarchical Clustering\n\n- No need to pre-specify number of clusters (can decide by cutting dendrogram).\n- Produces a full hierarchy of clusters.\n\n### K‑Means\n\n- Requires pre-specifying $K$.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Summary\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n#### Key Points\n\n\n- Hierarchical clustering builds a tree-like structure (dendrogram) to group similar data points\n   - **Distance Metrics** How we measure similarity between points:\n   - Euclidean distance (straight-line distance)\n   - Manhattan distance (city-block distance)\n   - Cosine distance (for directional data)\n\n- **Linkage Methods** \n   - How we measure distance between clusters:\n   - **Single**: Uses closest pair of points (can create chains)\n   - **Complete**: Uses farthest pair of points (creates compact clusters)\n   - **Average**: Uses average of all pairwise distances (balanced approach)\n   - **Ward's**: Minimizes increase in variance (creates similar-sized clusters)\n\n- **Dendrogram** \n   - Visual representation showing how clusters merge:\n   - Height shows distance when clusters merged\n   - Cutting at different heights gives different numbers of clusters\n\n\n- **Key Code Patterns:**\n\n```python\n# Basic hierarchical clustering\nfrom sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering\nagg = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=3, linkage='ward')\nlabels = agg.fit_predict(X)\n\n# Create dendrogram\nfrom scipy.cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram, linkage\nZ = linkage(X, method='ward')\ndendrogram(Z)\n```\n\n- **Important Takeaways**\n\n - **No \"Correct\" Answer** \n      - Unsupervised learning requires interpretation and domain knowledge\n      - **Multiple Methods** - Try different linkage methods and distance metrics\n      - **Evaluation is Key** - Use both internal (silhouette) and external (ARI) metrics\n\n\n:::\n<!-- end callout -->\n\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [Introduction to Statistical Learning in Python (ISLP)](https://www.statlearning.com/)\n- [IPython notebook from ISLP book](https://github.com/intro-stat-learning/ISLP_labs/blob/stable/Ch12-unsup-lab.ipynb)\n- Scikit‑learn documentation:\n  - [AgglomerativeClustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering.html)\n  - [KMeans](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html)\n\n",
